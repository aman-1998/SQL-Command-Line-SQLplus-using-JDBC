# SQL Command Line / SQLplus using JDBC

Using JDBC (Java Data Base Connectivity) , I have made a connection with Oracle 18c Express Edition. The driver used is of Type 4 driver (thin driver) and the IDE used is Eclipse. On running the program, in the input window any number of queries can be written and the output of that query would be printed below that (exactly similar to SQL command line / SQLplus).
